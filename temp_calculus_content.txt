    ## What is a Derivative?
    
    A derivative tells us how fast something is changing. Think of it as the slope of a curve at any point.
    
    ## The Mathematical Definition
    
    For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) is:
    f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
    
    ## Simple Example: The Power Rule
    
    If f(x) = x², then f'(x) = 2x
    
    This means:
    - At x = 1, the slope is 2
    - At x = 2, the slope is 4
    - At x = 3, the slope is 6
    
    ## Real-World Applications
    
    1. **Velocity**: How fast you're moving (derivative of position)
    2. **Acceleration**: How quickly your speed changes (derivative of velocity)
    3. **Economics**: Marginal cost and revenue
    4. **Physics**: Rate of change in any physical quantity
    
    ## Visual Understanding
    
    Imagine a hill. The derivative tells you how steep the hill is at each step.
    - Positive derivative = uphill
    - Negative derivative = downhill
    - Zero derivative = flat ground (local max/min)
    
    ## Key Takeaway
    
    Derivatives are everywhere! They help us understand change in our world.
