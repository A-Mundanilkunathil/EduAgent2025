What is a Derivative?
A derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. In simpler
terms, it tells us how quickly a function is changing at any given point.
1.1
Mathematical Definition
The derivative of a function f(x) is defined as:
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
(1)
This limit represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point x.
1.2
Example: Power Rule
For a simple function like f(x) = x2:
• The derivative is f ′(x) = 2x
• This means at any point x, the slope of the curve is 2x
• At x = 3, the slope is 6
• At x = 0, the slope is 0 (horizontal tangent)

Real-World Applications
1. Velocity: If position is s(t), then velocity is s′(t)
2. Acceleration: If velocity is v(t), then acceleration is v′(t)
3. Optimization: Finding maximum and minimum values
4. Economics: Marginal cost and revenue analysis
