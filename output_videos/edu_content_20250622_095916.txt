# Introduction to Derivatives in Calculus

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand what a derivative represents
- Recognize the basic derivative formula
- Connect derivatives to real-world applications
- Visualize slope at different points on a curve

## Content Breakdown
"Today we're exploring derivatives - a fundamental concept in calculus that measures how quickly things change. Imagine watching a car's speedometer: the derivative tells us the instantaneous speed at any moment, just like how the speedometer shows our current speed while driving.

The derivative is the slope of a curve at any point. For example, with f(x) = x², the derivative is 2x, meaning the slope changes as we move along the curve. At x = 0, the slope is flat, but at x = 3, the slope is 6.

We use derivatives to calculate velocity from position, acceleration from velocity, and even to optimize real-world scenarios in economics and engineering."

## Visual Elements Needed
- Animated curve of f(x) = x² with moving tangent line
- Speedometer animation transitioning to position-velocity graph
- Multiple tangent lines showing different slopes at various points
- Simple equation transformation showing power rule

## Key Takeaways
- A derivative measures instantaneous rate of change
- The derivative equals the slope of the tangent line
- Real-world applications include velocity, acceleration, and optimization
- For x², the derivative 2x tells us the slope at any point
