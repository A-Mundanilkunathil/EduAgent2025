# Introduction to Derivatives in Calculus

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand what a derivative represents
- Grasp the basic concept of instantaneous rate of change
- Recognize real-world applications of derivatives
- Apply the power rule in basic calculations

## Content Breakdown
[0-20s] Start with the core definition: A derivative measures how quickly a function changes at any point - like finding the exact speed of a car at a specific moment.

[20-40s] Demonstrate with a simple example using f(x) = x². Show how the derivative f'(x) = 2x gives us the slope at any point. Visualize this with a curve and moving tangent line.

[40-60s] Connect to real life: When GPS calculates your speed, it's using derivatives! Similarly, derivatives help engineers optimize designs and economists analyze markets.

## Visual Elements Needed
- Animated graph showing a parabola (f(x) = x²)
- Moving tangent line sliding along the curve
- Split screen showing real-world example (car speedometer) alongside mathematical representation
- Simple animation showing slope calculations at different points

## Key Takeaways
- A derivative shows the instantaneous rate of change
- The power rule (for x²→2x) is a fundamental example
- Derivatives appear everywhere in real life (speed, optimization, economics)
- Understanding derivatives unlocks practical problem-solving in many fields
