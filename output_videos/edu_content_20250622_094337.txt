# Introduction to Derivatives
Understanding the Basic Building Block of Calculus

## Key Learning Objectives
- Define what a derivative represents in mathematical terms
- Understand the practical meaning of a derivative as rate of change
- Connect derivatives to real-world applications
- Apply the concept through a simple power rule example

## Content Breakdown
[0:00-0:15] Definition
"A derivative measures how quickly a function changes at any point - imagine tracking the steepness of a roller coaster track at each moment."

[0:15-0:35] Mathematical Meaning
"When we find a derivative, we're calculating the slope of the tangent line at any point on a curve. Think of it as zooming in until a curved line looks straight."

[0:35-1:00] Simple Example
"Let's look at f(x) = x². Its derivative is 2x, meaning:
- At x=3, slope is 6
- At x=0, slope is 0 (flat)
This tells us exactly how steep our curve is at any point."

[1:00-1:30] Real Applications
"Derivatives are everywhere:
- Speed is the derivative of position
- Acceleration is the derivative of speed
- Business uses derivatives to optimize profits"

## Visual Elements Needed
- Animated curve with moving tangent line
- Side-by-side comparison of function and its derivative
- Real-world example animation (car accelerating)
- Simple parabola highlighting different slopes

## Key Takeaways
- Derivatives measure instantaneous rate of change
- They represent the slope at any point on a curve
- The power rule (x² → 2x) is the simplest derivative rule
- Derivatives connect math to real-world motion and change
