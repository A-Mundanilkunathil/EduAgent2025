# Introduction to Derivatives in Calculus

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concept of a derivative
- Recognize the derivative as a rate of change
- Connect derivatives to real-world applications
- Learn the power rule through a simple example

## Content Breakdown
(60-second script)
"A derivative is a mathematical tool that shows us how quickly something is changing. Imagine watching a car's speedometer – it tells you the rate of change of position, which is actually a derivative!

The most basic example is the function f(x) = x². Its derivative is 2x, meaning at any point, the rate of change equals twice the x-value. For instance, when x is 3, the rate of change is 6.

This concept applies everywhere: from calculating velocity and acceleration in physics to analyzing costs in economics. It's the mathematical way of measuring instantaneous change."

## Visual Elements Needed
- Animated graph of f(x) = x² with a moving tangent line
- Speedometer illustration transitioning to position-time graph
- Simple animation showing slope getting steeper as x increases
- Split screen showing real-world applications

## Key Takeaways
- A derivative measures instantaneous rate of change
- The derivative of x² is 2x (power rule example)
- Derivatives have practical applications in physics and economics
- The value of a derivative represents the slope at a point
