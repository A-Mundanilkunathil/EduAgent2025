# Introduction to Derivatives in Calculus

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand what a derivative represents
- Learn the basic concept of instantaneous rate of change
- Recognize real-world applications of derivatives
- Grasp the fundamental power rule example

## Content Breakdown
[0:00-0:15] Definition: A derivative measures how quickly a function changes at any point, like finding the slope of a curve at a specific location.

[0:15-0:35] Power Rule Example: Using f(x) = x², show how its derivative f'(x) = 2x gives us the slope at any point. At x=3, slope is 6; at x=0, slope is 0.

[0:35-1:00] Real-World Applications: Derivatives help us calculate:
- Speed from position
- Acceleration from velocity
- Maximum and minimum values in optimization problems

## Visual Elements Needed
- Animated graph showing a curve with a moving tangent line
- Side-by-side comparison of f(x) = x² and its derivative
- Simple animation showing position→velocity→acceleration relationship

## Key Takeaways
- Derivatives represent instantaneous rate of change
- The power rule is a fundamental tool for finding derivatives
- Derivatives have practical applications in physics and optimization
- The slope of the tangent line equals the derivative at that point
