# Introduction to Derivatives in Calculus

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concept of a derivative
- Recognize its mathematical definition
- Connect derivatives to real-world applications
- Grasp the power rule through a simple example

## Content Breakdown
"A derivative measures how quickly a function changes at any point. Think of it as finding the slope of a curve at a specific moment. For example, with f(x) = x², the derivative is 2x, meaning at x=3, the slope is 6. This helps us calculate things like velocity from position, or find maximum and minimum points of curves."

## Visual Elements Needed
- Animated curve of f(x) = x² with a tangent line sliding along it
- Highlighted point at x=3 showing slope = 6
- Simple motion graphic showing position→velocity→acceleration relationship

## Key Takeaways
- Derivatives represent instantaneous rate of change
- The power rule is a fundamental method for finding derivatives
- Real-world applications include velocity, acceleration, and optimization
- At any point, the derivative equals the slope of the tangent line
