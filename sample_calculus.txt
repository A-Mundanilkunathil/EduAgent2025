# Introduction to Derivatives in Calculus

## What is a Derivative?

A derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. In simpler terms, it tells us how quickly a function is changing at any given point.

### Mathematical Definition

The derivative of a function f(x) is defined as:

f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

This limit represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point x.

### Example: Power Rule

For a simple function like f(x) = x²:
- The derivative is f'(x) = 2x
- This means at any point x, the slope of the curve is 2x
- At x = 3, the slope is 6
- At x = 0, the slope is 0 (horizontal tangent)

### Real-World Applications

1. **Velocity**: If position is s(t), then velocity is s'(t)
2. **Acceleration**: If velocity is v(t), then acceleration is v'(t)
3. **Optimization**: Finding maximum and minimum values
4. **Economics**: Marginal cost and revenue analysis

### Practice Problems

1. Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x³ + 2x² - 5x + 1
2. What is the slope of y = x² at the point (2, 4)?
3. If the position of an object is s(t) = 16t², find its velocity at t = 3 seconds.

This foundational concept opens the door to understanding rates of change in all areas of science and mathematics.
