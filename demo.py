## What is a Derivative?

A derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how quickly the function
is changing at any given point.

### Mathematical Definition
The derivative is defined as:
f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

### Example: Power Rule
If f(x) = x², then f'(x) = 2x

This means the slope of the curve y = x² at any point x is 2x.

### Real-World Applications
- Velocity: derivative of position with respect to time
- Acceleration: derivative of velocity with respect to time
- Optimization: finding maximum and minimum values
