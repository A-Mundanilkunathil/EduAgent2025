# Quick Calculus: What is a Derivative?

## Core Concept
A derivative measures how fast a function changes.

## Simple Example
For f(x) = xÂ², the derivative is f'(x) = 2x

## What This Means
- At x = 1, slope = 2
- At x = 3, slope = 6  
- Bigger x = steeper slope

## Real Application
Speed is the derivative of distance!
